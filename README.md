# Color picker with Hex Code

### Note: only tested on Mac OS X 10.11, only expected to work on Macs that can compile OF 0.9

## Requirements
- [openframeworks 0.9 for Mac](http://openframeworks.cc)
- [ofxScreenGrab](https://github.com/genekogan/ofxScreenGrab)
- [ofxTextInputfield](https://github.com/Flightphase/ofxTextInputField)

## Known issue
- Will crash when move to another desktop with Mission Control
- Although text are highlightable, they are not really useable now (fixing)

More features will be added overtime since I actually want to use it.

## Why?
The default "Digital Color Meter" on Macs are useful but not sufficient especially if you are a web developer like me...because it doesn't have **HEX CODE** of the color! I searched on the Mac App Store and sure there are several solutions but they are either paid apps or just not good enough. I thought, I just need something that will read pixel colors off the screen and output it in hex code, shouldn't be that hard is it? Turns out, quite easy, well I saved some money!
